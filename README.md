Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

For this project, we were making a thermostat. The purpose was to read temperature changes in the air and update the temperature reading output every second. It also functioned to read button presses and flash the red LED light on when the set temperature was raised by clicking the left button to signify heat being turned on. When the set temperature was lowered by clicking the right button, the light would turn off. 

What did you do particularly well?

One thing I did exceptionally well was creating code according to industry standards that were clean and readable with appropriate comments. Everything functioned as intended with no unnecessary extra components. 

Where could you improve?

The temperature readings were in whole numbers, which could be improved by including decimals for more accuracy. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I had to rely heavily on reading this term, which was an excellent resource for my success. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The amount of research into the reading material has become a helpful skill I can carry into future projects.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I wanted to keep the code modular with clear naming conventions for better readability and maintainability to come back to and enhance in the future should the need arise.
